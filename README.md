This repository is to keep today's day in memory when GitHub's anti-spam system had flagged my account, thus [my profile](https://github.com/CaptainPRICE) and [all of my repositories](https://github.com/CaptainPRICE?tab=repositories) have gone from _public_ to _private_ - for free!
Obviously, my account was flagged as "false positive".
So, I had enjoyed being in "invisible mode" for about 3 hours :)
