# curly-octo-journey
The purpose of this repository is to remind me of (2017, May, 15) today's morning when GitHub's anti-spam system had flagged my account, thus [my profile](https://github.com/CaptainPRICE) and [all of my repositories](https://github.com/CaptainPRICE?tab=repositories) have gone from _public_ to _private_ - for free! Nobody could find any of my contributions/Gists either, because it always responded with "404 - Not Found" error page instead, he-hehe.  
However the thing was that I was still able to use GitHub (that is when I had created this repository at that time).  
It was obvious mistake made by anti-spam system, so yeah my account was flagged as "false positive".  
Since after 3 hours later I had received an e-mail from GitHub:  
> I'm sorry about our misbehaving spam-detecting robots - they do a good job but can be a bit overzealous at times. I've just unflagged your account and made your profile public again, you are all set!

And there I am "visible" to everyone again. I had enjoyed being in "invisible mode" for about 3 hours, hehe... :)
